[ERROR] Failed to create link 102 -> 202: Error: Link creation failed
[WARN] Failed to fetch context package for work item 102: [ 'Failed to fetch item 102' ]
A worker process has failed to exit gracefully and has been force exited. This is likely caused by tests leaking due to improper teardown. Try running with --detectOpenHandles to find leaks. Active timers can also cause this, ensure that .unref() was called on them.
