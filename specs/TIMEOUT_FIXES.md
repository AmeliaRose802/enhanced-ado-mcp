# Timeout Fixes - October 2025

## Problem Summary

Beta testing identified critical timeout issues across multiple AI-powered tools, particularly the `feature-decomposer` which consistently exceeded 60+ seconds and caused complete failures. The timeout problems damaged user trust and made several tools unusable in production.

### Issues Identified

1. **Feature Decomposer** - Consistent 60+ second timeouts, 100% failure rate
2. **Hierarchy Validator** - 30+ second delays with deep analysis
3. **Work Item Intelligence** - 10+ second delays 
4. **AI Assignment Analyzer** - Occasional timeouts on complex items
5. **Poor error messages** - Generic "timeout" errors provided no debugging context

### Root Causes

- Overly generous timeout values (120-180 seconds) that exceeded MCP protocol limits
- MCP protocol timeout (~60 seconds) triggered before tool timeout
- No guidance provided to users on how to work around timeouts
- AI model operations sometimes legitimately slow but no optimization

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Reduced Timeout Values

All AI-powered analyzers now have more aggressive timeouts aligned with user expectations:

| Tool | Old Timeout | New Timeout | Rationale |
|------|------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Feature Decomposer** | 180s (3 min) | 45s | Should decompose quickly; complexity indicates need to simplify |
| **Hierarchy Validator** | 180s (3 min) | 60s (1 min) | Most hierarchies validate fast; slow = too many items |
| **Work Item Intelligence** | 180s (3 min) | 90s (1.5 min) | Balanced for comprehensive analysis |
| **AI Assignment Analyzer** | 120s (2 min) | 30s | Simple decision, should be fast |

### 2. Enhanced Error Messages

All timeout errors now include:
- **Specific timeout duration** that was exceeded
- **Root cause explanation** (e.g., "feature too complex", "too many items")
- **Actionable suggestions** for how to resolve the issue
- **Alternative tools** where applicable

#### Examples

**Before:**
```
AI sampling timeout after 180 seconds
```

**After - Feature Decomposer:**
```
Feature decomposition exceeded 45 second timeout. This typically indicates the feature is too complex. Try simplifying the description or breaking it into smaller features first.
```

**After - Hierarchy Validator:**
```
Hierarchy validation exceeded 60 second timeout while analyzing 150 items. Try reducing MaxItemsToAnalyze or use validate-hierarchy-fast for large datasets.
```

**After - Work Item Intelligence:**
```
Work item intelligence analysis (full) exceeded 90 second timeout. The AI model may be overloaded. Try again in a moment or use a simpler AnalysisType.
```

**After - AI Assignment:**
```
AI assignment analysis exceeded 30 second timeout. The AI model may be overloaded. Try again in a moment.
```

## TypeScript Improvements

Fixed type safety issues in timeout Promise wrappers by properly typing reject promises as `Promise<never>`:

```typescript
// Before (type error)
const timeoutPromise = new Promise((_, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => reject(new Error('...')), timeoutMs);
});

// After (type safe)
const timeoutPromise = new Promise<never>((_, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    reject(new Error('...'));
  }, timeoutMs);
});
```

## Expected Outcomes

### Immediate Benefits

1. **Faster failure feedback** - Users know within 30-60s if a tool will timeout
2. **Better user experience** - Clear guidance on what went wrong and how to fix
3. **Reduced frustration** - Timeouts happen predictably, not after 3+ minutes
4. **MCP protocol alignment** - Timeouts occur within protocol limits

### Behavioral Changes

| Scenario | Old Behavior | New Behavior |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| Complex feature decomposition | Wait 180s → MCP timeout at 60s → generic error | Wait 45s → clear error with guidance to simplify |
| Large hierarchy validation | Wait 180s → unclear why it's slow | Wait 60s → error suggests validate-hierarchy-fast |
| Overloaded AI model | Wait 180s → no indication of cause | Wait 30-90s → error suggests retry or simpler analysis |

### Tools Affected

- ✅ `wit-feature-decomposer` - Now fails fast with guidance
- ✅ `wit-hierarchy-validator` - Suggests fast alternative
- ✅ `wit-work-item-intelligence-analyzer` - Multiple analysis types with different timeouts
- ✅ `wit-ai-assignment-analyzer` - Quick assignment decisions

### Recommendations for Users

1. **Feature Decomposer** 
   - If timing out, break the feature description into smaller, more focused features
   - Reduce the scope and level of detail in the initial decomposition request

2. **Hierarchy Validator**
   - For large backlogs (50+ items), use `wit-validate-hierarchy-fast` instead
   - Reduce `MaxItemsToAnalyze` parameter to analyze in smaller batches
   - Use `FilterByWorkItemType` to narrow the scope

3. **Work Item Intelligence**
   - Try simpler `AnalysisType` values first: 'completeness', 'ai-readiness', 'categorization'
   - Use 'full' analysis only when necessary
   - If overloaded, wait 30-60 seconds and retry

4. **AI Assignment**
   - Should rarely timeout - if it does, AI model is overloaded
   - Wait briefly and retry

## Testing Recommendations

Before releasing to beta testers:

1. Test each tool with intentionally complex inputs to verify timeout behavior
2. Verify error messages are clear and actionable
3. Confirm timeout values work within MCP protocol limits
4. Test that `validate-hierarchy-fast` is sufficient alternative for large datasets

## Future Improvements

### Short Term (Next Sprint)
- [ ] Add timeout values to tool documentation
- [ ] Create performance benchmarks for typical use cases
- [ ] Add telemetry to track actual timeout frequencies

### Medium Term (Next Quarter)
- [ ] Implement streaming/progressive results for long-running operations
- [ ] Add caching layer to avoid re-analyzing unchanged work items
- [ ] Optimize AI prompts to reduce token count and processing time

### Long Term (Future Consideration)
- [ ] Async job queue for operations expected to take >30 seconds
- [ ] Webhook/notification system for completed async operations
- [ ] Client-side retry logic with exponential backoff

## Version History

- **v1.4.1** (October 2025) - Initial timeout fixes implemented
