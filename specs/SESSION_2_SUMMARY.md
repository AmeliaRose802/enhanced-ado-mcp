# Bug Fix Session 2 - Quick Summary

**Date:** October 1, 2025  
**Status:** âœ… All reported bugs fixed

## What Was Fixed

### Bug #4: JSON Parsing Errors in Repository Tools
**Tools affected:** `wit-assign-to-copilot`, `wit-new-copilot-item`

**The problem:** Scripts were failing to parse JSON because:
1. `az` CLI error messages were getting mixed with JSON output (`2>&1`)
2. Output from called scripts wasn't being parsed correctly (arrays vs strings)

**The fix:**
- Changed stderr redirect to `2>$null` to keep JSON clean
- Enhanced JSON parsing to handle both string and array output
- Added try-catch blocks with helpful error messages

### Bug #5: Hierarchy Validator "No Work Items Found"
**Tool affected:** `wit-hierarchy-validator`

**The problem:** Tool was silently failing at various points in the pipeline with no diagnostics.

**The fix:**
- Added comprehensive error handling to all WIQL queries
- Added JSON parse error catching with response logging
- Added API error detection and reporting
- Enhanced logging throughout the entire pipeline

**Result:** If errors occur now, logs will show exactly where and why.
