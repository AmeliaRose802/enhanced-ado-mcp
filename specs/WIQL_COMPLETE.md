# ✅ WIQL Query Tool - Implementation Complete

## Summary
Successfully implemented the `wit-get-work-items-by-query-wiql` tool as requested by beta testers. This tool enables powerful querying of Azure DevOps work items using WIQL (Work Item Query Language).

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Schema & Validation (schemas.ts)
- Added `wiqlQuerySchema` with Zod validation
- Configuration defaults from MCP config (Organization, Project)
- Optional parameters for field selection and result limiting

### 2. Tool Configuration (tool-configs.ts)
- Registered tool with MCP server
- Comprehensive input schema documentation
- Example queries in description

### 3. Service Implementation (ado-work-item-service.ts)
- `queryWorkItemsByWiql()` async function
- Two-phase approach: WIQL query → fetch details
- Temporary file handling for complex queries
- Default fields + optional additional fields
- Proper error handling and cleanup

### 4. Tool Service Integration (tool-service.ts)
- Handler for 'wit-get-work-items-by-query-wiql'
- Azure CLI validation
- Zod schema parsing
- Structured response with metadata

### 5. Documentation (README.md)
- Added to Configuration & Discovery Tools section
- WIQL Query Examples section with 5+ real-world examples
- Link to official Azure DevOps WIQL documentation

### 6. Testing (wiql-query.test.ts)
- Basic query test
- Verification test harness
- Compiled successfully

## Key Features

✅ **Full WIQL Support** - Any valid WIQL query works
✅ **Flexible Field Selection** - Request any ADO fields via IncludeFields
✅ **Result Limiting** - MaxResults parameter with default of 200
✅ **Config Integration** - Inherits Organization/Project from MCP config
✅ **Consistent Auth** - Uses Azure CLI like other tools
✅ **Rich Response** - Returns full work item details + metadata
✅ **Error Handling** - Graceful handling of empty results and errors
✅ **Documentation** - Examples and usage guidance

## Response Structure

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "work_items": [...],
    "count": 10,
    "query": "SELECT...",
    "summary": "Found 10 work item(s) matching the query"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "source": "rest-api-wiql",
    "count": 10,
    "maxResults": 200
  },
  "warnings": [] // Warns if results truncated
}
```

## Common Use Cases Enabled

1. **Find work items by state** - Active, Closed, etc.
2. **Query by area path** - Specific teams or components
3. **Filter by work item type** - Tasks, Bugs, PBIs, etc.
4. **Time-based queries** - Recently changed items
5. **Tag-based searches** - Items with specific tags
6. **Complex filters** - Multiple conditions with AND/OR
7. **Sorted results** - Order by any field
8. **Bulk operations** - Fetch many items efficiently

## Build Status
✅ **Build Successful** - No compilation errors
✅ **Tool Registered** - Verified in tool configs
✅ **Function Compiled** - Present in dist/services/ado-work-item-service.js
✅ **Test Created** - wiql-query.test.ts ready for execution

## Beta Tester Benefits
