## üéØ Configuring Language Model Access (Sampling)

This MCP server includes **AI-powered analysis tools** that leverage VS Code's language model sampling capability to provide intelligent work item analysis. These features require proper configuration to access language models.

### Prerequisites for Sampling Features

1. **VS Code Insiders** or **VS Code Stable** (version 1.87+)
2. **GitHub Copilot** extension installed and active
3. **Language Model Access** enabled for the MCP server

### Enabling Language Model Access

When you first use an AI-powered tool (tools 5-8 below), VS Code will prompt you to grant language model access:

1. VS Code will show a permission dialog asking: **"Allow [enhanced-ado-msp] to access language models?"**
2. Click **"Allow"** to grant access
3. The permission is remembered for future requests

### Checking Language Model Access Status

You can verify if your MCP server has language model access:

```typescript
// In VS Code, the extension context provides:
context.languageModelAccessInformation.canSendRequest(chat)
```

If you encounter sampling errors, ensure:
- GitHub Copilot is active and authenticated
- You've granted language model access when prompted
- Your GitHub Copilot subscription is active

### Manual Configuration (Advanced)

Language model access is managed by VS Code and persists across sessions. To reset permissions:

1. Open VS Code Settings
2. Search for "Language Model"
3. Review and manage extension permissions under **Chat > Language Model Access**

**Note:** Claude Desktop and other non-VS Code MCP clients do not support sampling features. AI-powered tools (5-8) will gracefully degrade and return an error message indicating sampling is unavailable.

## WIQL Query Examples

The `wit-get-work-items-by-query-wiql` tool allows you to query Azure DevOps work items using WIQL (Work Item Query Language). Here are some common use cases:

### Basic Query - Find Active Work Items
```json
{
  "WiqlQuery": "SELECT [System.Id] FROM WorkItems WHERE [System.State] = 'Active' ORDER BY [System.ChangedDate] DESC"
}
```

### Query by Area Path
```json
{
  "WiqlQuery": "SELECT [System.Id] FROM WorkItems WHERE [System.AreaPath] UNDER 'MyProject\\MyTeam' AND [System.State] <> 'Closed'",
  "MaxResults": 50
}
```

### Query with Additional Fields
```json
{
  "WiqlQuery": "SELECT [System.Id] FROM WorkItems WHERE [System.WorkItemType] = 'Bug' AND [System.State] = 'Active'",
  "IncludeFields": [
    "System.Description",
    "Microsoft.VSTS.Common.Priority",
    "Microsoft.VSTS.Common.Severity",
    "System.Tags"
  ]
}
```

### Complex Query - Recently Changed Tasks
```json
{
  "WiqlQuery": "SELECT [System.Id] FROM WorkItems WHERE [System.WorkItemType] = 'Task' AND [System.ChangedDate] >= @Today - 7 ORDER BY [System.ChangedDate] DESC",
  "MaxResults": 100
}
```

### Query by Tags
```json
{
  "WiqlQuery": "SELECT [System.Id] FROM WorkItems WHERE [System.Tags] CONTAINS 'technical-debt' AND [System.State] <> 'Removed'"
}
```

**WIQL Reference:** For more information on WIQL syntax, see the [official Azure DevOps WIQL documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/queries/wiql-syntax).

## Bulk Operations Examples

The Enhanced ADO MCP Server provides powerful bulk operation tools for efficient backlog management and hygiene.

### Bulk State Transition

Transition multiple work items to a new state in one call with validation and dry-run support.

**Example: Remove multiple stale items**
```json
{
  "WorkItemIds": [12345, 12346, 12347],
  "NewState": "Removed",
  "Comment": "Automated backlog hygiene: Item inactive for >180 days with no substantive changes.",
  "Reason": "Abandoned",
  "DryRun": true
}
```

**Dry-Run Response:**
```json
{
  "dryRun": true,
  "summary": {
    "total": 3,
    "valid": 2,
    "invalid": 1,
    "wouldUpdate": 2
  },
  "validations": [
    {
      "workItemId": 12345,
      "valid": true,
      "currentState": "Active",
      "workItemType": "Task",
      "title": "Old task"
    },
    {
      "workItemId": 12346,
      "valid": false,
      "error": "Already in state 'Removed'"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Bulk Add Comments

Add comments to multiple work items with template support.

**Example: Notify about backlog review**
```json
{
  "Items": [
    {
      "WorkItemId": 12345,
      "Comment": "This item was reviewed during backlog hygiene on 2025-10-01. Last activity: 250 days ago."
    },
    {
      "WorkItemId": 12346,
      "Comment": "This item was reviewed during backlog hygiene on 2025-10-01. Last activity: 180 days ago."
    }
  ]
}
```

**Using Templates:**
```json
{
  "Items": [
    {"WorkItemId": 12345, "Comment": "placeholder"},
    {"WorkItemId": 12346, "Comment": "placeholder"}
  ],
  "Template": "Backlog hygiene review: {{analysisDate}}. Days inactive: {{daysInactive}}. Status: {{status}}",
  "TemplateVariables": {
    "analysisDate": "2025-10-01",
    "status": "Under review"
  }
}
```

### Find Stale Items

Purpose-built tool for backlog hygiene with staleness signals.

**Example: Find stale items in area path**
```json
{
  "AreaPath": "MyProject\\MyTeam",
  "MinInactiveDays": 180,
  "IncludeSubAreas": true,
  "IncludeSubstantiveChange": true,
  "IncludeSignals": true
}
```

**Response with Signals:**
```json
{
  "summary": {
    "total": 150,
    "stale": 25,
    "healthy": 125,
    "byRiskLevel": {
      "high": 8,
      "medium": 12,
      "low": 5
    }
  },
  "staleItems": [
    {
      "id": 12345,
      "title": "Old task",
      "state": "To Do",
      "daysInactive": 250,
      "signals": {
        "reasons": [
          "Inactive for 250 days",
          "Created 1000+ days ago",
          "In passive state (To Do)",
          "Unassigned",
          "No description"
        ],
        "riskLevel": "high"
      }
    }
  ],
  "categorized": {
    "high": [...],
    "medium": [...],
    "low": [...]
  }
}
```

### Computed Metrics in WIQL

Add computed metrics to WIQL queries for efficient analysis.

**Example: Query with computed metrics**
```json
{
  "WiqlQuery": "SELECT [System.Id] FROM WorkItems WHERE [System.AreaPath] UNDER 'MyProject\\MyTeam' AND [System.State] <> 'Done'",
  "ComputeMetrics": true,
  "StaleThresholdDays": 180,
  "IncludeFields": ["System.Description"]
}
```

**Response with Metrics:**
```json
{
  "work_items": [
    {
      "id": 12345,
      "title": "Some task",
      "computedMetrics": {
        "daysSinceCreated": 500,
        "daysSinceChanged": 200,
        "hasDescription": false,
        "isStale": true
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Development

Install deps:

```bash
npm install
```

Run in dev (ts-node/tsx):
```bash
npm run dev
```

Build:
```bash
npm run build
```

Start (after build):
```bash
npm start
```

## Integration (Example Client Snippet)

```ts
// Use an MCP client (e.g., Claude Desktop custom server config) pointing to: node dist/index.js
```

## Environment

Requires PowerShell 7 (`pwsh`) and Azure CLI already logged in with required `az boards` & `az repos` permissions.

Optional: set `PWSH_PATH` env var to override pwsh executable.

## Configuration

Authentication:
* Use `az login` (Azure CLI). The Azure DevOps extension is added automatically if missing.
* Personal Access Tokens are no longer supported/required; we intentionally removed that path.

View current configuration:
* Call tool `wit-get-configuration` with optional `Section` parameter to view specific configuration sections.

Verbose debug logging: set `MCP_DEBUG=1` or enable `toolBehavior.verboseLogging`.
