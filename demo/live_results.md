## 🤖 AI-Powered Insights

### Pattern Detection
- **Max VM Support** feature family has **25+ unestimated items** - needs sprint planning session
- **Compliance Asks** cluster shows **8 items** inactive 150+ days - consider deprioritization
- **Overlake deployment** items show active progress - good momentum
- **Global Cert Elimination** features blocked on external dependencies

### Risk Assessment
- **HIGH RISK:** 2 Risk items tracking active production concerns (WireServer down, unhealthy instances)
- **MEDIUM RISK:** Feature work without acceptance criteria may lead to scope creep
- **LOW RISK:** Active task completion rate suggests healthy team velocity

### Team Health Indicators
- ✅ **Good:** Recent activity on critical infrastructure items
- ⚠️ **Concern:** 96 dead items suggest over-commitment or changed priorities
- ⚠️ **Action Needed:** Unassigned work suggests capacity planning issues
