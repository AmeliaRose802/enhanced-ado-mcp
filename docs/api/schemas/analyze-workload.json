  "description": "AI-powered workload analysis to assess burnout risk, overspecialization, work-life balance issues, and professional health indicators. Accepts EITHER a single email (for individual analysis) OR an array of emails (for batch team analysis). When analyzing multiple people, processes up to 20 team members concurrently with configurable concurrency (default 5) and returns individual analyses plus team-level metrics (average health score, health distribution, top concerns). Automatically fetches completed and active work, calculates metrics, and provides actionable insights. Supports optional custom analysis intent (e.g., 'assess readiness for promotion', 'check for career growth opportunities'). Requires VS Code sampling support.",
