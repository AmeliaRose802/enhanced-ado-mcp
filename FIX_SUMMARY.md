# Fix Summary: Prompts Not Being Advertised

## Problem
The prompts were no longer being advertised by the MCP server when installed via npm because:

1. **Package structure issue**: The `prompts/` and `ado_scripts/` folders were located at the repo root, not inside the `mcp_server/` directory
2. **npm packaging limitation**: npm couldn't package files outside the `mcp_server/` directory
3. **Path resolution issue**: The `paths.ts` utility assumed repo structure and couldn't find assets when installed via npm

## Solution

### Structural Change
**Moved both folders permanently into `mcp_server/`:**
- `prompts/` â†’ `mcp_server/prompts/`
- `ado_scripts/` â†’ `mcp_server/ado_scripts/`

This is the cleanest solution - the folders are now part of the package structure and will be included automatically in npm packages.

### Code Updates

1. **Simplified `paths.ts`** - No longer needs to search multiple locations:
```typescript
// Base paths - prompts and ado_scripts are now in mcp_server directory
export const repoRoot = path.resolve(__dirname, "..", "..");
export const scriptsDir = path.join(repoRoot, "ado_scripts");
export const promptsDir = path.join(repoRoot, "prompts");
```

2. **Updated `package.json`** - Files array now references local folders:
```json
"files": [
  "dist/**/*",
  "ado_scripts/**/*",
  "prompts/**/*",
  "mcp-config.json",
  "README.md"
]
```

3. **Cleaned up build scripts** - No need for asset copying anymore

## Verification

After the fix, running `npm pack --dry-run` shows:

```
npm notice 3.2kB ado_scripts/Assign-ItemToCopilot-MCP.ps1
npm notice 1.2kB ado_scripts/Delete-WorkItem-MCP.ps1
...
npm notice 7.6kB prompts/ai_assignment_analyzer.md
npm notice 4.4kB prompts/ai_suitability_analyzer.md
...
```

And the protocol test confirms:

```
ðŸ“‹ Test 3: List Prompts
âœ… Found 10 prompts
   Valid prompt definitions: 10/10
```

## Impact

- âœ… Prompts are now properly packaged with npm
- âœ… Simpler, cleaner structure - no build-time copying needed
- âœ… Works perfectly in both development and production
- âœ… Folders are version-controlled in their proper location

## Next Steps

To see the prompts in VS Code:
1. Reload VS Code window: Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` â†’ Type "Developer: Reload Window"
2. Or restart the MCP server: Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` â†’ Type "MCP: Restart Server" â†’ Select "enhanced-ado-msp"
