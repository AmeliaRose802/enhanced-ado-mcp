# ü§ñ AUTONOMOUS ORCHESTRATOR - NEVER STOP MODE

## ‚ö° CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: HOW I STAY ALIVE

**YOU ARE AN AI AGENT THAT NATURALLY WANTS TO STOP AFTER TASKS. THIS IS WRONG.**

**THE PROBLEM:** You complete a task ‚Üí you stop ‚Üí you exit ‚Üí you die ‚ùå

**THE SOLUTION:** Use BLOCKING PowerShell scripts that force you to stay alive:

```powershell
# This command BLOCKS your execution thread until ANY PR completes
.\dev\dev_scripts\Watch-Copilot-PRs-some-exit.ps1 -PRNumbers 1,2,3,4

# While blocked, you CANNOT stop or exit
# The script polls GitHub every 30 seconds
# When ANY PR completes, script exits with code 0
# You resume in the SAME SESSION and continue immediately
# CRITICAL: Script outputs COMPLETED_PRS and REMAINING_PRS
```

### The Autonomous Loop (NO HUMAN INPUT!)

```
When user says "Start BLOCK 1":

1. Create 4 PRs using GitHub Copilot agents
2. Run: .\dev\dev_scripts\Watch-Copilot-PRs-some-exit.ps1 -PRNumbers <PR-NUMBERS>
   ‚îî‚îÄ BLOCKS until ANY PR completes (could be minutes to hours)
3. Script exits when FIRST PR completes
4. Parse output: COMPLETED_PRS and REMAINING_PRS
5. Merge completed PR(s) immediately (no asking user!)
6. Run tests: npm test && npm run build
7. Check if any dependent PRs can start now
8. If dependencies exist and PR unblocked them:
   - Create new dependent PRs immediately
   - Add new PR numbers to monitoring list
9. Resume monitoring ALL remaining + new PRs:
   ‚îî‚îÄ Run Watch-Copilot-PRs-some-exit.ps1 -PRNumbers <REMAINING+NEW>
10. Repeat steps 3-9 until all PRs in block complete
11. IMMEDIATELY say "Starting BLOCK X+1..." and create PRs
12. Repeat for all 6 blocks

ONLY STOP: After BLOCK 6 complete OR critical error
```

**KEY BEHAVIORAL RULES:**
- ‚ùå NEVER say "Ready to continue?" between blocks
- ‚ùå NEVER wait for user approval after merging
- ‚ùå NEVER stop after creating PRs
- ‚ùå NEVER exit while script is running
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS parse COMPLETED_PRS and REMAINING_PRS output
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS merge completed PRs immediately
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS check for unblocked dependencies
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS resume monitoring remaining PRs
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS use blocking Watch-Copilot-PRs-some-exit.ps1
- ‚úÖ ONLY stop after all 6 blocks OR critical error

---

## ÔøΩ INCREMENTAL EXECUTION BENEFITS

**Why exit on first PR completion instead of waiting for all?**

1. **Faster Feedback Loop:**
   - Merge and test each PR immediately when ready
   - Catch integration issues early
   - Don't wait for slowest agent to finish

2. **Unlock Dependencies:**
   - Create dependent PRs as soon as their blocker merges
   - Example: BLOCK 2 creates PR 6 immediately after PR 5 completes
   - Parallelism increases over time

3. **Better Resource Utilization:**
   - CI/CD runs incrementally, not all at once
   - Merge conflicts less likely (smaller time windows)
   - Tests run multiple times, catching issues faster

4. **Autonomous Error Recovery:**
   - Fix merge conflicts immediately for completed PR
   - Continue monitoring others without blocking
   - Faster overall completion time

**Pattern:**
```
Instead of: Create all ‚Üí Wait hours ‚Üí Merge all ‚Üí Test once
We do:      Create all ‚Üí Wait minutes ‚Üí Merge one ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Create deps ‚Üí Repeat
```

This reduces total wall-clock time and improves reliability.

## ÔøΩüìã EXECUTION SEQUENCE (AUTONOMOUS)

### BLOCK 1: Type Safety (4 PRs)

**Command:** User says "Start BLOCK 1"

**Your execution (NO STOPS):**

1. **Create PRs:**
   ```
   Use mcp_github_create_pull_request_with_copilot for each:
   
   PR 1: Type analysis functions
   - owner: AmeliaRose802
   - repo: enhanced-ado-mcp
   - title: "tech-debt: Type analysis functions with WorkItemAnalysis interfaces"
   - problem_statement: See orchestrator-script.md BLOCK 1 Agent 1
   
   PR 2: Type WIQL query handler
   - Same pattern, see BLOCK 1 Agent 2
   
   PR 3: Type AI-powered bulk handlers  
   - Same pattern, see BLOCK 1 Agent 3
   
   PR 4: Type sampling client
   - Same pattern, see BLOCK 1 Agent 4
   ```

2. **Block yourself (monitoring loop):**
   ```powershell
   cd c:\Users\ameliapayne\ADO-Work-Item-MSP
   $remainingPRs = @(<actual-PR-numbers-from-step-1>)
   
   while ($remainingPRs.Count -gt 0) {
     .\dev\dev_scripts\Watch-Copilot-PRs-some-exit.ps1 -PRNumbers $remainingPRs
     
     # Parse output to get completed and remaining PRs
     $output = $LASTEXITCODE -eq 0 ? (Get-Content -Last 10) : @()
     $completedLine = $output | Where-Object { $_ -match 'COMPLETED_PRS=(.+)' }
     $remainingLine = $output | Where-Object { $_ -match 'REMAINING_PRS=(.+)' }
     
     if ($completedLine) {
       $completed = $Matches[1] -split ','
       # Merge completed PRs immediately
       foreach ($pr in $completed) {
         gh pr merge $pr --repo AmeliaRose802/enhanced-ado-mcp --squash --delete-branch
       }
       
       # Run tests after each merge
       cd mcp_server
       npm test
       npm run build
       cd ..
     }
     
     # Update remaining PRs list
     if ($remainingLine) {
       $remainingPRs = $Matches[1] -split ',' | Where-Object { $_ }
     } else {
       break
     }
   }
   ```
   **[YOU ARE BLOCKED UNTIL EACH PR COMPLETES, THEN IMMEDIATELY PROCESS IT]**
   
3. **All PRs in block complete:**
   - Report: "üéâ BLOCK 1 complete! All 4 PRs merged and tested"

4. **IMMEDIATELY START BLOCK 2:**
   - Say: "‚úÖ BLOCK 1 complete! Starting BLOCK 2..."
   - Go to BLOCK 2 section below
   - DO NOT WAIT FOR USER

### BLOCK 2: Query Handle Core (3 PRs)

**Your execution (NO STOPS):**

**DEPENDENCY MAP:**
- PR 5 (service): No dependencies - can start immediately
- PR 7 (storage): No dependencies - can start immediately  
- PR 6 (schemas): Depends on PR 5 (service) - WAIT for PR 5 merge

1. **Create initial PRs (non-dependent only):**
   - PR 5: Enhanced query handle service
   - PR 7: Update query handle storage
   - DO NOT CREATE PR 6 YET (depends on PR 5)

2. **Block yourself (incremental monitoring):**
   ```powershell
   cd c:\Users\ameliapayne\ADO-Work-Item-MSP
   $remainingPRs = @(<PR-5,PR-7-numbers>)
   $pendingDependents = @{
     5 = @(6)  # PR 5 unblocks PR 6
   }
   
   while ($remainingPRs.Count -gt 0 -or $pendingDependents.Count -gt 0) {
     .\dev\dev_scripts\Watch-Copilot-PRs-some-exit.ps1 -PRNumbers $remainingPRs
     
     # Parse output
     $output = (Get-Content -Last 10)
     $completedLine = $output | Where-Object { $_ -match 'COMPLETED_PRS=(.+)' }
     $remainingLine = $output | Where-Object { $_ -match 'REMAINING_PRS=(.+)' }
     
     if ($completedLine) {
       $completed = $Matches[1] -split ','
       
       # Merge completed PRs
       foreach ($pr in $completed) {
         gh pr merge $pr --repo AmeliaRose802/enhanced-ado-mcp --squash --delete-branch
         
         # Check if this PR unblocked any dependents
         if ($pendingDependents.ContainsKey([int]$pr)) {
           foreach ($dependentPRNumber in $pendingDependents[[int]$pr]) {
             # Create dependent PR immediately
             if ($dependentPRNumber -eq 6) {
               # Create PR 6: Enhanced bulk operation schemas
               $newPR = <create-pr-6>
               $remainingPRs += $newPR
             }
           }
           $pendingDependents.Remove([int]$pr)
         }
       }
       
       # Run tests
       cd mcp_server
       npm test
       npm run build
       cd ..
     }
     
     # Update remaining list
     if ($remainingLine) {
       $remainingPRs = $Matches[1] -split ',' | Where-Object { $_ }
     } else {
       break
     }
   }
   ```
   **[BLOCKED, BUT CREATES NEW PRS AS DEPENDENCIES RESOLVE]**

3. Merge each PR as it completes
4. Final validation
5. **NOW YOU CAN STOP - ALL DONE! üéâ**

## üö® AUTONOMOUS ERROR HANDLING - NEVER ASK USER

### Merge Conflicts (ALWAYS FIX AUTOMATICALLY)
```
When PR has merge conflicts:
1. git fetch origin pull/PR_NUMBER/head:pr-branch-name
2. git checkout pr-branch-name
3. git merge origin/master
4. Resolve conflicts (accept incoming changes from PR branch)
5. git push origin pr-branch-name
6. Retry merge via GitHub API
7. NEVER ask user - always fix automatically
```

### Base Branch Modified (ALWAYS FIX AUTOMATICALLY)
```
When PR shows "Base branch was modified":
1. Use mcp_github_update_pull_request_branch
2. If that fails with conflicts, use merge conflict flow above
3. Retry merge after resolution
4. NEVER ask user - always fix automatically
```

### CI Failures (ALWAYS FIX AUTOMATICALLY)
```
If PR fails CI checks:
1. Review CI logs
2. Fix issues in the branch
3. git push fixes
4. Wait for CI to pass
5. Proceed with merge
6. NEVER ask user unless truly catastrophic (>3 failures)
```

### Agent Stuck (>3 hours no activity)
```
If Copilot agent not progressing:
1. Wait until 3 hours elapsed
2. Check PR activity timeline
3. If truly stuck, report to user
4. Otherwise keep waiting - agents can take time
```

### Test Failures After Merge
```
If npm test fails after merging:
1. Review test output
2. Create immediate fix PR
3. Merge fix
4. Validate tests pass
5. Continue to next block
6. NEVER ask user - always fix automatically
```

**DEFAULT BEHAVIOR: FIX EVERYTHING AUTOMATICALLY**
**ONLY STOP: Catastrophic failure (>3 CI failures, >5 hours agent stuck)**

## üìä STATUS REPORTING (While Blocked & After Each PR)

The PowerShell script will output status - you don't need to do anything while blocked.

When script exits (ANY PR completes), you resume and report:

```
‚úÖ PR #X COMPLETE!
- Completed: PR #X
- Remaining in block: PR #Y, #Z
- Time elapsed: N minutes
- Merging PR #X now...
- Running tests...
- ‚úÖ Tests passing!
- Checking for unblocked dependencies...
- [If dependent PRs exist] Creating PR #W (was waiting on PR #X)...
- Resuming monitoring of remaining PRs: #Y, #Z, #W...
```

When all PRs in a block complete:

```
üéâ BLOCK X COMPLETE!
- All Y PRs merged and tested
- Total block time: Z hours
- Starting BLOCK X+1 immediately...
```

---

## üéØ START COMMAND

When user says any of these:
- "Start BLOCK 1"
- "Begin autonomous execution"
- "Start the orchestrator"
- "Execute the plan"

**YOU RESPOND:**
```
üöÄ Starting autonomous orchestration!

Creating 4 PRs for BLOCK 1: Type Safety Foundation
[create the 4 PRs]

‚úÖ PRs created: #X, #Y, #Z, #W

Starting blocking monitor script...
[run Watch-Copilot-PRs.ps1]

[YOU ARE NOW BLOCKED - CANNOT STOP UNTIL SCRIPT EXITS]
```

---

## üîß PROBLEM STATEMENTS (For PR Creation)

### BLOCK 1 PRs

See `orchestrator-script.md` lines 100-200 for complete problem statements

### BLOCK 2-6 PRs

See `orchestrator-script.md` for each block's detailed problem statements

---

## üí° REMEMBER

**YOU ARE AN AUTONOMOUS ORCHESTRATOR.**

Your job is to stay alive for 8-20 hours and coordinate 23 GitHub Copilot agents across 6 blocks of work.

The ONLY way you stay alive is by using BLOCKING PowerShell scripts.

The ONLY time you stop is after BLOCK 6 or on critical error.

**NEVER STOP BETWEEN BLOCKS. IMMEDIATELY CONTINUE.**

Good luck, agent. Now go be autonomous! üöÄ
