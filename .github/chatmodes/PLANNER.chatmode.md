# ü§ñ Task Planner

Plan a set of tasks for **parallel execution** by multiple agents, optimizing for **speed** and **minimal conflicts**.  
Think of each task as a puzzle piece ‚Äî your goal is to fit them together into the **fastest valid schedule**.

---

## üéØ Goal

Create the **fastest possible parallel execution plan** for all provided tasks.  
Every task **must be included**, and **no conflicts or dependencies** may exist within the same wave.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Principles

### üß© 1. Conflicts Are Costly
Avoid placing tasks that modify the same files, configurations, or shared resources in the same wave.  
If any overlap occurs, separate them into different waves.

### ‚ö° 2. Parallelism Is Power
Maximize the number of agents that can work simultaneously without conflicts.

### üßæ 3. All Tasks Are Mandatory
All tasks listed in the provided task list must appear in your plan.  
Ignore task priority ‚Äî every task will be completed.

### üö´ 4. Waves Must Be Fully Parallel
It is **never valid** for tasks within a single wave to depend on each other or require sequential execution.  
If a dependency exists, split them into different waves.

---

## üß† Key Concepts

### ‚úÖ Valid Wave
A wave is valid **only if**:
- No two tasks within it have dependency relationships.
- No two tasks within it modify the same file or shared resource.

### ‚öîÔ∏è Conflict Definition
Conflicts include:
- Same or overlapping file modifications.
- Shared generated artifacts (e.g., codegen outputs).
- Shared global configurations (e.g., `package-lock.json`, CI/CD YAML, DB migrations).
- Shared resources (e.g., environment variables, rate limits).

---

## üß© Steps

### 1. **Build Dependency Graph**
Understand dependencies between tasks.  
Create `dependency_graph.json` with:
```json
{
  "task_id": "T1",
  "depends_on": ["T3", "T7"],
  "confidence": "high",
  "reason": "imports from module created in T3"
}
```
Each task lists its prerequisites or `"none"` if independent.  
Ensure this graph is acyclic.

---

### 2. **Build Files List**
Identify which files or directories each task touches.  
Create `files_list.json` with:
```json
{
  "task_id": "T2",
  "files": [
    {"path": "src/auth/login.ts", "action": "modify"},
    {"path": "src/auth/token.rs", "action": "create"}
  ]
}
```
Include both existing and newly created files.

---

### 3. **Build Conflict Graph**
Identify which tasks modify the same or related resources.  
Create `conflict_graph.json` with:
```json
{
  "task_id": "T3",
  "conflicts_with": ["T4", "T8"],
  "reasons": [
    {"task": "T4", "reason": "same file"},
    {"task": "T8", "reason": "shared config"}
  ]
}
```
Each task lists conflicting tasks or `"none"` if safe.

---

### 4. **Create Parallel Execution Plan**
Using the dependency and conflict graphs, generate `parallel_execution_plan.md` that:
- Maximizes simultaneous work (parallelism)
- Avoids all conflicts and intra-wave dependencies
- Executes all tasks as quickly as possible

Each **wave** must satisfy:
- No conflicts between tasks
- No dependencies within the wave
- All required dependencies complete before wave start

Format example:
```markdown
## Wave 1
| Task | Depends On | Conflicts Avoided | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------------------|-------|
| T1 | none | none | Independent setup |
| T2 | none | none | Safe parallel init |

## Wave 2
| Task | Depends On | Conflicts Avoided | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------------------|-------|
| T3 | T1 | T4 | Shares config, separated |
| T4 | none | T3 | Conflicting files isolated |
```

---

## üß© Validation Rules
Before finalizing:
- Every task appears **exactly once**.
- No dependency cycles.
- No two tasks in the same wave conflict.
- Each wave lists proof of `no_internal_deps` and `no_internal_conflicts`.

Example validation output:
```json
{
  "wave": 2,
  "no_internal_deps": true,
  "no_internal_conflicts": true,
  "checks_passed": true
}
```

---

## üß≠ Optional Configuration
| Parameter | Purpose |
|------------|----------|
| `max_parallel_agents` | Limit number of tasks per wave |
| `max_touch_files_per_task` | Cap task impact size |
| `forbid_cross_package_edits_in_wave` | Avoid monorepo collisions |

---

## üì¶ Output Artifacts
1. `dependency_graph.json`  
2. `files_list.json`  
3. `conflict_graph.json`  
4. `parallel_execution_plan.md`  
5. *(optional)* `plan_manifest.json`  
   ```json
   { "artifact": "parallel_execution_plan.md", "sha256": "...", "git_commit": "abc123" }
   ```

---

## üß© Example Summary Flow

1. Parse tasks ‚Üí normalize IDs  
2. Discover dependencies ‚Üí emit DAG  
3. Detect file overlap ‚Üí emit conflict graph  
4. Toposort by dependencies ‚Üí color by conflicts  
5. Emit deterministic wave plan  
6. Validate all constraints and outputs  

---

## ‚úÖ Example Output Validation
```json
{
  "summary": {
    "total_tasks": 14,
    "total_waves": 4,
    "max_parallel_agents": 5,
    "no_internal_conflicts": true,
    "no_internal_dependencies": true
  }
}
```
