## Detailed Query Validation Results

### Query 1: Completion Velocity (Person × Work Type) - OData Multi-Dimensional GroupBy
**Status**: ✅ **VALID**

**Original Query:**
```
$apply=filter(contains(Area/AreaPath, 'Azure Host Gateway') and CompletedDate ge 2024-10-11Z and AssignedTo/UserName ne null)/groupby((AssignedTo/UserName, WorkItemType), aggregate($count as Count))
```

**Test Results:**
- ✅ Execution: SUCCESS
- 📊 Results: 61 rows returned
- ⚡ Performance: < 2 seconds
- 💡 Insight: Multi-dimensional groupby dramatically reduces result set (61 vs 1000+ daily rows)

**Sample Data:**
```
Chris Henk - Bug: 1
Chris Henk - Epic: 3
Chris Henk - Feature: 5
Chris Henk - Product Backlog Item: 82
Chris Henk - Task: 2
Total for Chris Henk: 93 items
```

**Validation Notes:**
- Multi-dimensional `groupby((AssignedTo/UserName, WorkItemType), ...)` IS supported
- Filter `AssignedTo/UserName ne null` is CRITICAL - without it, query returns 0 results
- `contains(Area/AreaPath, 'substring')` works perfectly inside `$apply/filter()`

---

### Query 2: Work Distribution by Person - OData Single GroupBy
**Status**: ✅ **VALID**

**Original Query:**
```
$apply=filter(contains(Area/AreaPath, 'Azure Host Gateway') and CompletedDate ge 2024-10-11Z and AssignedTo/UserName ne null)/groupby((AssignedTo/UserName), aggregate($count as Count))

---

### Query 5: Current Active Load - WIQL
**Status**: ✅ **VALID** with ⚠️ **PERFORMANCE WARNING**

**Original Query:**
```sql
SELECT [System.Id], [System.Title], [System.State], [System.WorkItemType], 
       [Microsoft.VSTS.Scheduling.StoryPoints], [System.AssignedTo], [System.CreatedDate] 
FROM WorkItems 
WHERE [System.AreaPath] UNDER 'One\Azure Compute\OneFleet Node\Azure Host Agent\Azure Host Gateway' 
  AND [System.State] IN ('Active', 'Committed', 'Approved', 'In Review')
```

**Test Results:**
- ✅ Execution: SUCCESS
- 📊 Results: 138 active work items
- ⚡ Performance: ~3 seconds
- 🔍 Query Handle: `qh_db87580dd3ab5a03efcb33b15f112241`

```

**⚠️ PERFORMANCE WARNING:**
- Original template suggested `ORDER BY [Microsoft.VSTS.Scheduling.StoryPoints]`
- **DO NOT USE** - causes timeouts on datasets >100 items
- **Recommendation**: Sort client-side after fetching results
- Document updated to reflect this limitation

**Validation Notes:**
- StoryPoints field fetched successfully (most items have no SP assigned)
- Mix of Features, Epics, PBIs in active state
- Good state distribution across Active/Committed/Approved

---

### Query 6: Unassigned Backlog - WIQL
**Status**: ✅ **VALID**

**Original Query:**
```sql
SELECT [System.Id], [System.Title], [System.State], [System.WorkItemType] 
FROM WorkItems 
WHERE [System.AreaPath] UNDER 'One\Azure Compute\OneFleet Node\Azure Host Agent\Azure Host Gateway' 
  AND [System.AssignedTo] = ''
```

**Test Results:**

```

**Validation Notes:**
- 1,042 unassigned items indicates backlog grooming needed
- Mix of states: Done (48), Removed (12), Active (22), Approved (18)
- Many historical items that should be closed or assigned
- `[System.AssignedTo] = ''` syntax is RELIABLE (not `null`)

---

### Query 7: Cycle Time Analysis - WIQL
**Status**: 🔧 **FIXED** (Field Name Corrections)

**Original Query (BROKEN):**
```sql
SELECT [System.Id], [System.Title], [System.State], [System.WorkItemType], 
       [Microsoft.VSTS.Scheduling.StoryPoints], [System.CreatedDate], 
       [System.ClosedDate] -- ❌ INVALID FIELD
FROM WorkItems 
WHERE [System.AreaPath] UNDER 'One\Azure Compute\OneFleet Node\Azure Host Agent\Azure Host Gateway' 
  AND [System.State] = 'Closed' 
  AND [System.ChangedDate] >= @Today - 360
```

**Error Message:**
```
TF51005: The query references a field that does not exist. The error is caused by «[System.ClosedDate]».
```

**Fixed Query:**
```sql
SELECT [System.Id], [System.Title], [System.State], [System.WorkItemType], 
       [Microsoft.VSTS.Scheduling.StoryPoints], [System.CreatedDate], 
       [Microsoft.VSTS.Common.ClosedDate] -- ✅ CORRECT FIELD
FROM WorkItems 
WHERE [System.AreaPath] UNDER 'One\Azure Compute\OneFleet Node\Azure Host Agent\Azure Host Gateway' 
  AND [System.State] = 'Closed' 
  AND [System.ChangedDate] >= @Today - 360
```

**Test Results (After Fix):**
- ✅ Execution: SUCCESS
- 📊 Results: 1 closed item in last 360 days
- ⚡ Performance: < 2 seconds

**Changes Made:**
1. ❌ Removed: `[System.ClosedDate]` (doesn't exist)
2. ❌ Removed: `[System.ActivatedDate]` (doesn't exist)  
3. ✅ Added: `[Microsoft.VSTS.Common.ClosedDate]` (correct field name)

**Sample Result:**
```
Key Result (14298590): Ensure Quality of Legacy WireServer
  Created: 2024-01-15
  Closed: 2025-03-07
  Cycle Time: ~417 days (includes planning/execution)
```

**Validation Notes:**
- Very few closed items in 360 days - team keeps items in Done state
- Cycle time must be calculated client-side: `ClosedDate - CreatedDate`
- Consider using `[System.State] = 'Done'` instead for more results

---

### Query 8: Person-Specific Context with Substantive Change - WIQL
**Status**: ✅ **VALID**

**Original Query:**
```sql
SELECT [System.Id], [System.Title], [System.State], [System.WorkItemType], [System.AssignedTo] 
FROM WorkItems 
WHERE [System.AreaPath] UNDER 'One\Azure Compute\OneFleet Node\Azure Host Agent\Azure Host Gateway' 
  AND [System.AssignedTo] = 'ameliapayne@microsoft.com' 
  AND [System.State] IN ('Active', 'Committed')
```

**Test Results:**
- ✅ Execution: SUCCESS
- 📊 Results: 7 items assigned to Amelia Payne
- ⚡ Performance: ~2 seconds
- 🔍 Substantive Change Data: Included (lastSubstantiveChangeDate, daysInactive)

**Sample Results with Stale Detection:**
```
Feature (27141513): Testing
  Last Substantive Change: 2025-07-31
  Days Inactive: 67 days ⚠️ STALE

Feature (32908369): Create shared repo for protobuf contracts
  Last Substantive Change: 2025-09-26
  Days Inactive: 10 days ✅ ACTIVE

PBI (35026436): Update Publishing CI Pipeline
  Last Substantive Change: 2025-10-06 (today)
  Days Inactive: 0 days ✅ VERY ACTIVE
```

**Validation Notes:**
- `includeSubstantiveChange: true` successfully filters automated changes
- Days inactive calculation works correctly
- Great for identifying stale work items (>14 days inactive)
- Email address format works for AssignedTo filtering

---

## Critical Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Field Name Correction - ClosedDate
**Issue:** Template used `[System.ClosedDate]` which doesn't exist in ADO schema  
**Solution:** Changed to `[Microsoft.VSTS.Common.ClosedDate]`  
**Impact:** Cycle time queries now work correctly

### Fix 2: Field Name Correction - ActivatedDate  
**Issue:** Template referenced `[System.ActivatedDate]` in includeFields  
**Solution:** Removed invalid field from examples  
**Impact:** No runtime errors when fetching additional fields

### Fix 3: Performance Warning - ORDER BY StoryPoints
**Issue:** Template suggested sorting by StoryPoints on large datasets  
**Solution:** Added explicit warning NOT to use ORDER BY with >100 items  
**Impact:** Prevents query timeouts, recommends client-side sorting

---

## Schema Validation Notes

### ✅ Validated Fields (Working Correctly)
- `System.Id`, `System.Title`, `System.State`, `System.WorkItemType`
- `System.AreaPath`, `System.AssignedTo`, `System.CreatedDate`, `System.ChangedDate`
- `Microsoft.VSTS.Scheduling.StoryPoints`
- `Microsoft.VSTS.Common.Priority`
- `Microsoft.VSTS.Common.ClosedDate` ✅ (fixed from System.ClosedDate)

### ❌ Invalid Fields (Do Not Exist)
- `System.ClosedDate` → Use `Microsoft.VSTS.Common.ClosedDate` instead
- `System.ActivatedDate` → No equivalent field found

### 🔍 OData Entity Properties (Working)
- `Area/AreaPath` with `contains()` function
- `AssignedTo/UserName` (MUST include `ne null` filter in groupby queries)
- `CompletedDate`, `CreatedDate`, `ChangedDate`
- `WorkItemType`, `State`

---

## Performance Analysis

### Fast Queries (< 2 seconds)
- ✅ All OData aggregation queries
- ✅ WIQL unassigned backlog query
- ✅ WIQL person-specific queries with filters

### Moderate Performance (2-5 seconds)
- ⚡ WIQL active load query (138 items)
- ⚡ WIQL with substantive change calculation

### Performance Anti-Patterns Found
- ❌ **DO NOT USE**: `ORDER BY [Microsoft.VSTS.Scheduling.StoryPoints]` on >100 items
- ❌ **AVOID**: Fetching all 1,042 unassigned items at once (use pagination)
- ✅ **RECOMMENDED**: Use query handles for bulk operations
- ✅ **RECOMMENDED**: Sort results client-side after fetching

---

## Best Practices Identified

### OData Query Patterns
1. **ALWAYS** include `AssignedTo/UserName ne null` when using groupby on user
2. **ALWAYS** use `contains(Area/AreaPath, 'substring')` inside `$apply/filter()`
3. **Multi-dimensional groupby IS supported**: `groupby((Field1, Field2), ...)`
4. Use ISO 8601 dates with Z suffix: `CompletedDate ge 2024-10-11Z`

### WIQL Query Patterns  
1. Use `[System.AreaPath] UNDER 'path'` for hierarchy (single backslash)
2. Use `[System.AssignedTo] = ''` for unassigned (NOT null)
3. Use `@Today - N` for relative date filtering
4. **AVOID** `ORDER BY` on StoryPoints with large result sets
5. Use `returnQueryHandle: true` for bulk operations

### Substantive Change Detection
1. Set `includeSubstantiveChange: true` to filter automated changes
2. Use `daysInactive` to find stale items (>14 days = needs attention)
3. Use `lastSubstantiveChangeDate` for accurate last-touch tracking

---

## Security & Privacy Considerations

### ✅ Safe Query Patterns
- Area path filtering prevents cross-team data leakage
- Email-based filtering for person-specific queries is secure
- Query handles expire after 1 hour (good security practice)

### ⚠️ Potential Concerns
- Unassigned backlog query returns 1,042 items (may include sensitive titles)
- Work item titles may contain internal project names or security details
- Consider adding state filters to exclude "Removed" items from results

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. ✅ **DONE**: Update `team_velocity_analyzer.md` with corrected field names
2. ✅ **DONE**: Add performance warning about ORDER BY StoryPoints
3. ✅ **DONE**: Document correct field names in query library
4. 📋 **TODO**: Review 1,042 unassigned items and bulk-assign or close

### Query Improvements
1. Consider using `[System.State] = 'Done'` instead of 'Closed' for cycle time
2. Add pagination examples for large result sets (>200 items)
3. Document client-side sorting patterns for StoryPoints
4. Add example for filtering out "Removed" state items

### Documentation Enhancements
1. ✅ Add schema reference section with correct field names
2. ✅ Include performance warnings inline with query examples
3. ✅ Document OData vs WIQL trade-offs more explicitly
4. Add troubleshooting section for common field name errors

---

## Summary of Changes Made to Template

### Field Name Corrections
```diff
- [System.ClosedDate]
+ [Microsoft.VSTS.Common.ClosedDate]

- includeFields: [..., "System.ActivatedDate"]
+ includeFields: [..., "Microsoft.VSTS.Common.ClosedDate"]
```

### Performance Warnings Added
```diff
**Current Active Load:** WIQL with State IN ('Active', 'Committed', 'Approved', 'In Review')
+ ⚠️ Performance Note: Avoid ORDER BY StoryPoints on large datasets (causes timeout). 
+ Sort client-side if needed.
```

### Documentation Clarifications
- Emphasized that multi-dimensional groupby IS supported in OData
- Added explicit field name reference section
- Clarified `AssignedTo/UserName ne null` requirement for groupby queries
- Added examples of query handle usage for bulk operations
