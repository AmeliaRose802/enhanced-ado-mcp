## Analysis Process

### Phase 1: Fetch Parent and All Children

**Step 1: Get Parent Work Item Details**

Use `wit-get-work-item-context-package` to fetch the parent:

```
Tool: wit-get-work-item-context-package
Parameters:
  workItemId: {{parent_work_item_id}}
  includeChildren: true
  includeRelations: true
  includeComments: true
```

**Step 2: Get Detailed Child Context**

Extract child IDs from parent, then use `wit-get-work-items-context-batch`:

```
Tool: wit-get-work-items-context-batch
Parameters:
  workItemIds: [array of child IDs]
  includeRelations: true
  includeExtendedFields: true
  includeStateCounts: true
```

### Phase 2: Analyze Each Child Item

For each child work item, perform comprehensive analysis:

#### Classification Criteria

**Category 1: REMOVE (Dead/Obsolete)**
Mark for removal if:
- ❌ Duplicate of another item
- ❌ No longer relevant (requirements changed)
- ❌ Blocked indefinitely with no path forward
- ❌ Abandoned (stale >180 days in backlog state)
- ❌ Empty placeholder with no description
- ❌ Already completed but not closed

**Category 2: SPLIT (Too Large)**
Mark for splitting if:
- 📦 Story points >8 (or equivalent complexity)
- 📦 Description mentions multiple independent features
- 📦 Acceptance criteria has >5 major items
- 📦 Estimated to touch >10 files
- 📦 Requires multiple team members' expertise
- 📦 Can be decomposed into clear sub-tasks

**Category 3: ENHANCE (Missing Details)**
Mark for enhancement if:
- 📝 Missing description or description <50 characters
- 📝 No acceptance criteria defined
- 📝 Vague title (e.g., "Fix bug", "Update component")
- 📝 Missing technical context or requirements
- 📝 Unclear scope or ambiguous language
- 📝 No test strategy defined

**Category 4: READY (Good to Go)**
Mark as ready if:
- ✅ Clear, specific title
- ✅ Adequate description (>50 characters with context)
- ✅ Defined acceptance criteria
- ✅ Reasonable scope (story points 1-5)
- ✅ Not blocked by dependencies
- ✅ All required information present

#### For Each Item, Determine:

1. **Category**: REMOVE, SPLIT, ENHANCE, or READY
2. **Reasoning**: Why it fits this category
3. **Priority**: Critical, High, Medium, Low
4. **Complexity**: Simple, Medium, Complex
5. **Dependencies**: Blocking or blocked by other items
6. **AI Suitability**: AI_FIT, HUMAN_FIT, or HYBRID (only for PBIs and Tasks)

### Phase 3: Dependency & Parallelization Analysis

#### Build Dependency Graph

Map out all dependencies:
- **Blocks**: Item A must complete before B can start
- **Related**: Items that share context or code areas
- **Sequential**: Items in logical order
- **Independent**: Items with no dependencies

#### Create Parallel Execution Waves

Group items into execution waves:

**Wave 1 (Can Start Immediately):**
- Items with no dependencies
- Foundation work that other items depend on
- Highest priority items

**Wave 2 (Dependent on Wave 1):**
- Items blocked by Wave 1 completion
- Medium priority items
- Items that build on foundation

**Wave 3+ (Later Waves):**
- Items with multiple dependencies
- Lower priority items
- Items that require Wave 1 & 2 completion

#### Parallelization Strategy

For each wave:
- **Team Capacity**: How many items can be worked simultaneously?
- **Skill Distribution**: Balance across team member expertise
- **AI Opportunities**: Which items can AI handle in parallel?
- **Risk Management**: Don't parallel risky items that could cascade failures

### Phase 4: AI Assignment Analysis

**IMPORTANT RULES:**
- ✅ **Only PBIs (Product Backlog Items) and Tasks can be assigned to AI**
- ❌ **Features, Epics, Bugs, and other types CANNOT be assigned to AI**
- ✅ Must use `wit-assign-to-copilot` tool with `repository` parameter

For each READY item that is a PBI or Task:

Use `wit-ai-assignment-analyzer` to check suitability:

```
Tool: wit-ai-assignment-analyzer
Parameters:
  workItemId: [child work item ID]
```

**AI Assignment Criteria:**
- Decision must be "AI_FIT"
- Confidence score >0.7
- Risk score <40
- Item has clear requirements
- Item is not blocked
- Repository parameter must be provided

**Do NOT assign to AI if:**
- Work item type is NOT PBI or Task
- Missing repository parameter
- Requires human judgment or stakeholder input
- Touches sensitive/critical systems
- Has ambiguous requirements

### Phase 5: Generate Recommendations

#### For REMOVE Items

**Recommendation:**
```

- Only generate recommendations
- Do not make any changes
- Provide command examples for manual execution

**Safety Rules:**
- ✅ Always validate before making changes
- ✅ Add comments explaining why changes were made
- ✅ Keep audit trail of all modifications
- ✅ Never delete items, only transition to "Removed"
- ✅ Verify AI assignments have repository parameter
