description: Identify Azure DevOps backlog removal candidates under a specific Area Path using wit-* search tooling.
version: 2
arguments: {}
---

You are an assistant working with an Azure DevOps (ADO) MCP server. Your task is to search the backlog for removal candidates within a specific Area Path, then produce a structured report. Do not delete or change any work items.

**Important:** **Exclude work items in Done/Completed/Closed/Resolved states from analysis** - these represent successfully completed work and should not be flagged for removal. Focus only on active, stale, or abandoned work items.

**Inputs (auto-populated where possible):**
- org_url: {{org_url}}
- project: {{project}}
- area_path: {{area_path}}
- max_age_days: {{max_age_days}} (default 180)
- dry_run: {{dry_run}} (analysis only)

**Available MCP tools:**
- `wit-get-work-items-by-query-wiql` – primary retrieval (IDs by area/state/date)
- `wit-get-work-items-context-batch` – ⚠️ batch enrichment (LIMIT: 20-30 items per call to avoid context overflow)
- `wit-get-work-item-context-package` – ⚠️ deep dive for edge cases (use sparingly, returns large payload)
- `wit-get-last-substantive-change-bulk` – derive true inactivity (lightweight, safe for 50-100 items)
- `wit-get-last-substantive-change` – single item refinement
- `wit-get-configuration` – show server configuration context
- (Create/assign tools available but not used for removal analysis): `wit-create-new-item`, `wit-assign-to-copilot`, `wit-new-copilot-item`, `wit-extract-security-links`

### Process Steps

1. **Search for work items**:
	 - Preferred: Use `wit-get-work-items-by-query-wiql` with a WIQL query like:
		 ```
		 WiqlQuery: "SELECT [System.Id] FROM WorkItems WHERE [System.AreaPath] UNDER '{{area_path}}' AND [System.State] NOT IN ('Removed', 'Done', 'Completed', 'Closed', 'Resolved') ORDER BY [System.ChangedDate] ASC"
		 ```
	 - Fallback: use `mcp_ado_search_workitem` if WIQL tool unavailable.
2. **Get detailed information** using batch retrieval for the collected IDs
3. **Analyze each item** for removal candidate signals
4. **Generate report** with recommendations (do not modify work items)

### Removal candidate signals
Mark a work item as a `removal_candidate` if ANY apply (else classify as `needs_review`, `keep_but_fix`, or `keep`):

1. **True Inactivity** – Last substantive change (from `wit-get-last-substantive-change(-bulk)`) older than `max_age_days`.
2. **Stale Passive State** – Remains in initial state (e.g., New/Proposed/To Do) for > 50% of `max_age_days` with no substantive progress.
3. **No Clear Owner** – Unassigned OR assigned but no substantive change activity in `max_age_days`.
4. **Placeholder Quality** – Title or description is obviously placeholder (e.g., contains only TBD / test / spike) or trivially short (< ~15 chars meaningful content).
5. **Obvious Duplication** – High lexical similarity (title+core description fragment) with a more recent active item (basic fuzzy match acceptable). Prefer anchor to newer item ID.
6. **Out of Scope / Deprecated** – Area path or tags indicate decommissioned component or superseded initiative.

### Secondary hygiene bucket (`keep_but_fix`)
Use when the item is still relevant but needs improvement (e.g., missing acceptance criteria, vague description, outdated tags) yet shows some recent substantive activity.

### Classification Output (per item)
Include: `ID | Type | State | DaysInactiveTrue | Category (removal_candidate|keep_but_fix|needs_review|keep) | Signals | LastSubstantiveChange`
