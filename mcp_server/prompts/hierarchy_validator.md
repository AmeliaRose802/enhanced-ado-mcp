## Hierarchy Analysis Framework

### Core Validation Principles

**üèóÔ∏è Structural Hierarchy Best Practices**
- **Epic ‚Üí Feature ‚Üí User Story ‚Üí Task**: Standard Azure DevOps hierarchy
- **Initiative ‚Üí Epic ‚Üí Feature ‚Üí Story**: Enterprise-level hierarchies
- **Theme ‚Üí Epic ‚Üí Feature ‚Üí Story**: Product-focused organizations
- **Bug ‚Üí Task**: Bug remediation breakdown
- **Test Plan ‚Üí Test Suite ‚Üí Test Case**: Testing hierarchies

**üéØ Logical Relationship Validation**
- **Scope Containment**: Child items must be logical subsets of parent scope
- **Content Alignment**: Related functionality should share appropriate parents
- **Type Appropriateness**: Validate work item type relationships
- **Level Consistency**: Items at similar scope levels should be peer items

**üìä Organizational Alignment**
- **Area Path Consistency**: Related items should align with team boundaries
- **Iteration Alignment**: Parent-child items should have compatible timelines
- **Assignment Patterns**: Consider team ownership and collaboration needs

### Analysis Methodology

**Phase 1: Automatically Retrieve Work Item Context**

**If work_item_ids provided:**
IMMEDIATELY use `wit-get-work-items-context-batch` to fetch complete information for the specified IDs:

```
Tool: wit-get-work-items-context-batch
Arguments: {
  "WorkItemIds": [{{work_item_ids}}]
}
```

**If no work_item_ids provided:**
Use WIQL to find recent work items in the configured area path, then fetch with batch tool:

```
WiqlQuery: "SELECT [System.Id] FROM WorkItems WHERE [System.AreaPath] UNDER '{{area_path}}' AND [System.State] NOT IN ('Removed', 'Done', 'Closed', 'Completed', 'Resolved') ORDER BY [System.ChangedDate] DESC"
MaxResults: 20
```

Then IMMEDIATELY call `wit-get-work-items-context-batch` with the discovered IDs (limit to 15-25 items max to avoid context overflow).

**Retrieved context includes:**
- Title, type, state, priority
- Parent ID and child IDs (relationshipContext)
- Area path, iteration path
- Comment count, linked PRs/commits
- hasParent, hasChildren, isOrphaned flags
- Related work item counts

**Do NOT ask the user to provide these details manually.**

**Phase 2: Structural Assessment**
Once you have the work item context from Phase 1, analyze hierarchy relationships below.

**üî¥ Critical Issues (High Priority)**
- **Orphaned High-Level Items**: Epics/Features without appropriate parents
- **Type Violations**: Invalid parent-child type combinations
- **Circular Dependencies**: Items creating circular reference patterns
- **Scope Mismatches**: Children significantly larger than parents

**üü° Structural Issues (Medium Priority)**
- **Misparented Items**: Logically related items under different parents
- **Level Inconsistencies**: Items at inappropriate hierarchy levels
- **Organizational Misalignment**: Items crossing team/area boundaries inappropriately
- **Timeline Conflicts**: Parent-child items with incompatible schedules

**üü¢ Optimization Opportunities (Low Priority)**
- **Consolidation Opportunities**: Similar items that could share parents
- **Clarity Improvements**: Titles and relationships that could be clearer
- **Structure Refinements**: Minor adjustments for better organization

**Phase 3: Intelligent Suggestions**

**üéØ Parent Matching Algorithm**
1. **Content Similarity Analysis**: Compare titles, descriptions, and acceptance criteria
2. **Scope Relationship Assessment**: Identify containment and subset relationships
3. **Type Compatibility Check**: Validate appropriate work item type hierarchies
4. **Team Boundary Respect**: Consider area path and ownership patterns
5. **Timeline Alignment**: Assess iteration and milestone compatibility

### Issue Categories & Solutions

**üìã Orphaned Items Analysis**
- **Root Cause**: Missing parent relationships for dependent items
- **Impact**: Reduced visibility, planning challenges, unclear ownership
- **Solution Strategy**: 
  - Identify appropriate parent candidates based on scope and content
  - Consider creating new parent items if none exist
  - Validate team ownership and area path alignment

**üîÑ Misparented Items Analysis**
- **Root Cause**: Items assigned to logically unrelated parents
- **Impact**: Confusing structure, reduced team efficiency, planning difficulties
- **Solution Strategy**:
  - Analyze content overlap and logical relationships
  - Identify better parent candidates with stronger content alignment
  - Consider scope and timeline compatibility

**‚ö†Ô∏è Type Hierarchy Violations**
- **Root Cause**: Inappropriate work item type relationships
- **Impact**: Workflow confusion, reporting issues, process violations
- **Solution Strategy**:
  - Validate against organizational hierarchy standards
  - Suggest type changes where appropriate
  - Recommend structural reorganization if needed

### üìã Implementation Guidance

**Immediate Steps:**
1. **Review Critical Issues**: Address orphaned high-level items first
2. **Validate Suggestions**: Confirm proposed parent relationships with team leads
3. **Plan Reorganization**: Schedule hierarchy updates during low-activity periods

**Process Improvements:**
- Establish hierarchy review checkpoints in planning meetings
- Create work item templates with appropriate parent guidance
- Implement hierarchy validation in Definition of Done

**Monitoring & Maintenance:**
- Regular hierarchy health checks (monthly/quarterly)
- Team training on proper work item organization
- Automated alerts for common hierarchy violations

## Context Information (Auto-Populated)

**Organization:** {{org_url}}
**Project:** {{project}}
**Area Path:** {{area_path}}
**Work Item IDs:** {{work_item_ids}} (optional - if not provided, analyzes recent items in area path)

**Note:** Configuration values are automatically injected from the MCP server configuration. You do not need to prompt the user for organization, project, or area path details.

**IMPORTANT**: 
- This tool performs analysis and provides recommendations only. It does not modify any work items or parent-child relationships.
- **Work items in Done/Completed/Closed/Resolved states are automatically excluded from analysis** to focus on active work.
- All suggested changes should be reviewed and implemented manually by appropriate team members.
