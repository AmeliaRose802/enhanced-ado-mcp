- ⚠️ Complex integration: WebSocket server, FCM setup (HUMAN_FIT)
- ✅ Well-defined scope: Clear acceptance criteria (AI_FIT)
- ⚠️ External dependencies: Firebase config (HUMAN_FIT)

### Recommended Action
🔄 Split work:
**Human tasks:**
- Design WebSocket server architecture
- Configure Firebase Cloud Messaging
- Define notification data schema

**AI tasks:**
- Implement notification UI components
- Create data models from schema
- Write unit tests for models
- Generate API client code

### Estimated Scope
- Files: 8-12 files
- Complexity: Medium

### Guardrails
- Tests required: ✅ Yes (integration tests with mock WebSocket)
- Feature flag: ✅ Yes (gradual rollout)
- Code review: ✅ Yes (architecture review required)
```

**Impressive stat:** *"The AI didn't just say 'yes' or 'no' - it gave us a detailed decomposition strategy with specific tasks for humans and AI, plus guardrails!"*

### Current Issues
- Vague title - doesn't specify the actual problem
- Description lacks reproduction steps
- No acceptance criteria defined
- Missing device/browser information
- No verification method specified

### Recommended Improvements

**Enhanced Title:**
Fix login button click handler not responding on mobile Safari iOS 15+

**Enhanced Description:**
## Problem
The login button on the authentication page fails to respond to touch events 
on mobile Safari (iOS 15+). Users tap multiple times with no response.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Open app on iPhone (iOS 15+) using Safari
2. Navigate to /login page
3. Fill in username and password
4. Tap "Login" button
5. Observe: Button doesn't change state, no network request triggered

Generate a WIQL query to find all unassigned bugs created in the last 14 days, then show me the first 5 items
```

**What happens:**
1. AI converts natural language → valid WIQL
2. Validates query syntax (up to 3 iterations if needed)
3. Executes query and returns **query handle** (e.g., `qh_abc123...`)
4. Query handle is valid for 1 hour
5. Can use handle for safe bulk operations (no manual IDs!)

**Expected Output:**
```markdown
## Generated WIQL Query

**Natural Language:** Find all unassigned bugs created in the last 14 days

**Generated Query:**
SELECT [System.Id], [System.Title], [System.State], [System.CreatedDate]
FROM WorkItems
WHERE [System.TeamProject] = 'YourProject'
  AND [System.AreaPath] UNDER 'YourProject\\YourArea'
  AND [System.WorkItemType] = 'Bug'
  AND [System.AssignedTo] = ''
  AND [System.CreatedDate] >= @Today - 14
  AND [System.State] NOT IN ('Done', 'Closed', 'Removed')
ORDER BY [System.CreatedDate] DESC

**Validation:** ✅ Query syntax valid
**Execution:** ✅ Query executed successfully
**Query Handle:** qh_7f8e9d3c2b1a...
**Results:** 23 items found

## Demo 6: ⚡ Bulk AI Operations with Confidence Scoring

**What to say:** *"Now watch this - I can estimate Story Points for hundreds of items in seconds with AI confidence scores."*

### Command (using query handle from Demo 5):
```
Use wit-bulk-assign-story-points-by-query-handle to estimate Story Points for query handle qh_7f8e9d3c2b1a with fibonacci scale, only unestimated items, and dry-run mode first
```

**What happens:**
1. AI analyzes each item's title, description, type, and context
2. Estimates Story Points using fibonacci (1,2,3,5,8,13)
3. Provides confidence score (0.0-1.0) per item
4. Shows reasoning for each estimate
5. Dry-run mode lets you review before applying
6. **Preserves ALL manual estimates** (never overwrites)

**Expected Output:**
```markdown
## Bulk Story Points Estimation (DRY RUN)

**Query Handle:** qh_7f8e9d3c2b1a
**Items Analyzed:** 23 bugs
**Scale:** Fibonacci
**Mode:** Dry run (no changes applied)

### Summary
- High confidence (>0.7): 21 items (91%)
- Medium confidence (0.5-0.7): 2 items (9%)
- Low confidence (<0.5): 0 items (0%)
- **Total estimated effort:** 67 Story Points

### Results (Sample)
| ID | Title | Estimate | Confidence | Reasoning |
|----|-------|----------|------------|-----------|
| 34523 | Login timeout on mobile | 5 | 0.88 | Medium complexity: Mobile-specific bug, requires device testing, network debugging |
| 34521 | Search results not loading | 8 | 0.75 | Medium-high: API integration issue, multiple failure points, requires investigation |
| 34519 | Profile page 404 error | 3 | 0.92 | Low-medium: Routing issue, straightforward fix, minimal testing |
| 34517 | API returns 500 on /users | 5 | 0.81 | Medium: Backend error, needs log analysis, error handling, testing |
| 34515 | Dashboard widgets broken | 8 | 0.68 | Medium-high: Multiple widgets affected, unclear root cause, extensive testing needed |

### Recommendations
✅ Apply estimates confidently - 91% high confidence rate
✅ Total estimated effort: 67 SP
⚠️ Review medium-confidence items (2) before final approval

### Next Action
Run with `dryRun: false` to apply estimates
```

**Follow-up command to actually apply:**
```
Now run the same command with dryRun set to false to actually apply the estimates
```

**Impressive stat:** *"We just estimated 23 bugs in under 30 seconds with 91% high confidence. That would've taken a 2-hour estimation meeting with the whole team!"*

## Demo 7: 📈 Multi-Dimensional Analytics with OData

**What to say:** *"Want to see something really powerful? Multi-dimensional analytics from natural language."*

### Command:
```
Generate an OData query to show completion velocity by person and work type for the last 90 days
```

**What happens:**
1. AI converts natural language → complex OData with multi-dimensional groupby
2. Validates syntax and executes query
3. Returns aggregated metrics (dramatically reduces result size)
4. Much more efficient than daily breakdowns (20-50 rows vs 90+ rows)

**Expected Output:**
```markdown
## Generated OData Query

**Natural Language:** Show completion velocity by person and work type for last 90 days

**Generated Query:**
$apply=filter(
  contains(Area/AreaPath, 'YourArea') and 
  CompletedDate ge 2024-07-08Z and 
  AssignedTo/UserName ne null
)/groupby(
  (AssignedTo/UserName, WorkItemType), 
  aggregate($count as Count)
)

**Results:** 24 rows (instead of 90+ daily rows - 73% reduction!)

### Completion Velocity by Person & Type
