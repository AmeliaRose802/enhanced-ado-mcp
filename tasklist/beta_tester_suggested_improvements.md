## Top 5 AI-Optimized Work Item Management Tools

### 1. **Full Context Package Retrieval**
**Tool**: `get-work-item-context-package`

**What it does**: Single API call returns everything AI needs:
- Work item details (fields, description, ACs)
- Parent + all children (if epic/feature)
- All comments with timestamps
- Related work items (links, dependencies, blocks)
- Recent history (last 10 changes)
- Related PRs/commits (if any)

**Why critical**: Currently I need 5-10 separate calls to gather full context. This is slow, expensive, and I often miss important context. One call = complete picture instantly.

**Example use**: "Get me everything about work item 12345 so I can help the user"

### 2. **Batch Work Item Retrieval with Relationships**
**Tool**: `get-work-items-batch-with-context`

**What it does**: Get 10-50 work items in one call with:
- All item details
- Relationship graph between them (parent-child, related, blocks)
- Aggregated metrics (total story points, risk score, AI-suitable count)
- Returned as graph structure (not nested JSON)

**Why critical**: When helping with sprint planning, feature work, or backlog grooming, I need to see multiple items and how they relate. Making 50 individual calls is impossible.

**Example use**: "Show me all items in Sprint 23 with their relationships"

### 3. **Smart Work Item Search with AI Context**
**Tool**: `search-work-items-semantic`

**What it does**: 
- Natural language query: "Find incomplete items related to authentication that are blocking other work"
- Semantic search (not just keyword matching)
- Returns ranked results with relevance scores
- Includes relationship context (why this item matches)

**Why critical**: Current search is keyword-based. Users describe what they want conversationally, and I need to find the right items. This bridges human intent → work items.

**Example use**: User says "What's blocking the login feature?" → AI finds all blockers semantically

### 4. **Work Item Validation & Scoring**
**Tool**: `validate-work-item-quality`

**What it does**:
- Check if item meets DoR/DoD criteria
- Validate acceptance criteria are testable and complete
- Check for common issues (missing links, no parent, stale, etc.)
- Return actionable feedback: "Add parent link", "Clarify AC #2", "Add priority"
- Bulk mode: validate 20 items at once

**Why critical**: I can help users fix work items proactively. Before they ask "Is this ready?", I can say "No, because X, Y, Z - here's how to fix it."

**Example use**: Before sprint planning, validate all items in "Ready" state

### 5. **AI Work Session Management**
**Tool**: `manage-ai-work-session`

**Operations**:
- **Claim**: Mark item as "AI working on this" to prevent conflicts
- **Checkpoint**: Save progress: "Completed analysis, starting implementation"
- **Update**: Auto-update work item as AI makes progress (comments, state changes)
- **Complete**: Mark done with AI-generated summary of changes
- **Handoff**: Transfer to human with context: "I'm stuck on X, here's what I tried"

**Why critical**: When AI (me) works on items autonomously, I need to:
- Prevent multiple AIs/humans from conflicting
- Track progress transparently
- Update work items automatically (not make user do it)
- Seamlessly hand off when stuck

**Example use**: User assigns me an item → I claim it → update it as I work → complete or escalate with full context

## Why These 5?

1. **Context Package** - Solves the "death by 1000 API calls" problem
2. **Batch Retrieval** - Enables multi-item workflows (planning, grooming, dependencies)
3. **Semantic Search** - Bridges natural language → work items (what users actually do)
4. **Validation** - Proactive quality gates before problems occur
5. **Session Management** - Enables autonomous AI work with proper coordination

These 5 tools would transform me from "chat assistant that looks up work items" to "autonomous agent that manages work items end-to-end."
