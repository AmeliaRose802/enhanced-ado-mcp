## 🔴 CRITICAL PRIORITY (P0) - Production Blockers

### **1. Fix All Failing Tests** ✅ COMPLETE

**Status:** All tests passing (49 tests, 5 suites)  
**Impact:** Test foundation established for safe refactoring  
**Completed:** Phase 1

**Completed Tasks:**
- [x] Fixed Jest configuration/parsing errors
- [x] Resolved TypeScript/module resolution issues
- [x] All test suites passing
- [x] Documented test running procedures

**Results:**

- ✅ No parsing or configuration errors
- ✅ 49 tests across 5 suites passing
- ✅ Test coverage maintained

---

### **2. ID Hallucination Bug** 🚨

**Status:** Critical data integrity issue affecting all bulk operations  
**Impact:** Agent removes/modifies wrong work items  
**Risk:** HIGH - Potential data loss across all workflows  
**Effort:** 2-3 weeks for full implementation  
**Owner:** TBD

**Problem Statement:**
All Azure DevOps agent workflows that modify work items suffer from LLM hallucination of work item IDs. Agent queries for items, user requests action, but agent hallucinates different IDs during execution.

**Solution:** Implement Query Handle Architecture (detailed in `halucination_fix_proposal.md`)

**Phase 1: Core WIQL Enhancement (Week 1)** ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Add `return_query_handle` parameter to `wit-get-work-items-by-query-wiql`
- [x] Implement query handle generation and storage (in-memory/Redis)
- [x] Add query handle expiration (default 1 hour, configurable)
- [x] Add query handle cleanup job
- [x] Implement handle retrieval and validation functions
- [x] Add comprehensive error handling for expired/invalid handles
- [x] Unit tests for query handle lifecycle
- [ ] Load tests (1000+ items, concurrent handles)

**Phase 2: Bulk Operation Tools (Week 2)** ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Implement `wit-bulk-update-by-query-handle`
- [x] Implement `wit-bulk-comment-by-query-handle`
- [x] Implement `wit-bulk-assign-by-query-handle`
- [x] Implement `wit-bulk-remove-by-query-handle`
- [x] Add dry_run support to all bulk tools
- [x] Add comprehensive error handling
- [x] All handlers registered in tool service
- [x] Integration tests (WIQL → bulk operation flow)

**Phase 3: Agent Prompt Updates (Week 3)** ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Update `find_dead_items` prompt to use query handles
- [x] Create universal query handle pattern documentation (`resources/query-handle-pattern.md`)
- [x] Update `child_item_optimizer` prompt to use query handles
- [x] Register query handle pattern resource in resource service
- [x] Update resources README with query handle pattern
- [x] Add anti-hallucination verification steps to prompts
- [ ] Test prompts with various scenarios (manual testing phase)
- [ ] Validate zero hallucination incidents in testing (manual validation)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ Query handles stored and retrieved correctly
- ✅ Bulk operations use handles, not direct IDs
- ✅ Dry-run mode works for all bulk operations
- ✅ All prompts updated to use new pattern
- ✅ Documentation complete
- ✅ Query handle pattern registered as MCP resource
- 🔄 Zero ID hallucination incidents in testing (manual validation pending)

**Success Metrics:**
- Before: ~5-10% of bulk operations have ID hallucination
- After: 0% hallucination rate (structurally impossible)

**Files to Create/Modify:**
- `mcp_server/src/services/query-handle-service.ts` (NEW)
- `mcp_server/src/services/ado-work-item-service.ts` (MODIFY)
- `mcp_server/src/config/tool-configs.ts` (MODIFY)
- All prompts in `mcp_server/prompts/`

---

### **3. OData 401 Token Timeout** ✅ COMPLETE

**Status:** Fixed - automatic token refresh on 401 errors  
**Impact:** Tools no longer stop working on token expiration  
**Effort:** 2 days (completed)  
**Owner:** Completed

**Tasks:**
- [x] Implement token refresh logic in `ado-http-client.ts`
- [x] Add authentication error detection (401 responses)
- [x] Add automatic retry with token refresh
- [x] Add logging for token refresh events
- [ ] Test with long-running sessions (2+ hours) - requires manual validation
- [ ] Document token lifecycle - needs documentation update

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ Server handles 401 errors gracefully (lines 191-197 in ado-http-client.ts)
- ✅ Tokens refresh automatically when expired (clearTokenCache + retry)
- ✅ No manual restart required for token issues
- ⏳ Long-running sessions work reliably (needs manual validation)

**Implementation Details:**
- Detection: `if (response.status === 401 && !_isRetry)`
- Action: `clearTokenCache()` and retry request once
- Location: `mcp_server/src/utils/ado-http-client.ts` lines 191-197

**Files Modified:**
- `mcp_server/src/utils/ado-http-client.ts`
- `mcp_server/src/utils/ado-token.ts`

## 🟠 HIGH PRIORITY (P1) - Feature Completeness

### **4. Fix `includeSubstantiveChange` Feature** 📊

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - Feature fixed and working  
**Impact:** Beta tester reports feature "completely non-functional"  
**Effort:** 2-3 days  
**Owner:** Completed

**Beta Test Feedback:**
> "The entire premise of the prompt (using `includeSubstantiveChange: true` to get activity data in one call) FAILED. This forced me to make additional batch calls, defeating the tool's primary value proposition."

**Tasks:**
- [x] Debug why `substantiveChangeAnalysis` returns false
- [x] Review `wit-get-last-substantive-change-bulk` implementation
- [x] Test with various work item types and states
- [x] Add batching (10 items at a time) to prevent overwhelming API
- [x] Improve error handling - proper catching and reporting
- [x] Add detailed logging for debugging
- [x] Update all documentation to match reality

**Fixes Implemented:**
- ✅ Added batching (10 items at a time) instead of parallel processing all items at once
- ✅ Improved error handling - errors now properly caught and reported
- ✅ Added detailed logging (batch progress, success/error counts)
- ✅ Changed from warning to error logging when calculation fails
- ✅ Feature makes N API calls (one per work item) - no batch API available

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ `includeSubstantiveChange: true` returns activity data
- ✅ `daysInactive` and `lastSubstantiveChangeDate` populated
- ✅ Feature works at scale (100+ items with batching)
- ✅ Proper error handling for failed items

**Files Modified:**
- `mcp_server/src/services/ado-work-item-service.ts` - Fixed batching and error handling
- All prompts using this feature already updated

## 🚨 Risk Management

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| ID Hallucination in Production | 🔴 CRITICAL | Implement query handle architecture ASAP |
| Failing Tests Block Development | 🔴 HIGH | Fix tests immediately, highest priority |
| Token Timeout in Long Sessions | 🟠 MEDIUM | Implement token refresh, standard pattern |
| Substantive Change Feature Broken | 🟠 MEDIUM | Fix or remove, update docs |
| Prompt Quality Issues | 🟡 LOW | Iterative improvement, thorough testing |
| Scope Creep During Cleanup | 🟡 LOW | Create Issues for future work, stay focused |

---

## 💡 Key Principles

1. **Tests First** - Fix test suite before any other work
2. **Data Integrity** - Query handle architecture prevents hallucination at architectural level
3. **No False Promises** - Docs and prompts must match reality
4. **Iterative Improvement** - Don't try to fix everything at once
5. **Create Issues** - Track discovered debt for future work
6. **Beta Test Feedback is Gold** - Prioritize issues they identified
7. **Don't Break Things** - Tests must pass before and after changes

---

## 📝 Notes & Decisions

### Why Query Handle Architecture?
The proposal in `halucination_fix_proposal.md` is architecturally sound. It eliminates ID hallucination by:
- Server maintains authoritative ID list
- Agent passes opaque tokens, never IDs
- Structurally impossible to hallucinate
- Works across ALL bulk operations

### Why Tests First?
Cannot safely refactor or add features without working tests. This is non-negotiable engineering fundamentals.

### Why Not Remove Broken Features Immediately?
Some features might be fixable with reasonable effort. Try to fix first, remove if unfixable. But be decisive - don't spend weeks on a feature that should be removed.
