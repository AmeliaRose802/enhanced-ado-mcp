- See package response.md. Don't include assocated items in a removed or done state since they aren't very useful
    - Make this response as minimal and useful as you can

- Clean up the codebase and make it more AI ready. Don't break things. Improve the archetecture and reduce tech debt. There may be some unused files which should all be deleted

- Should not pop up browser to get token. No idea what is going on

- The prompt for enhacing a work item still asks for way too much stuff

- Review all prompts to remove marketing fluff etc and make them as tight and focused as possible. They should all output links in a valid format. None should look at done or removed items except the velocity one. Generally make them clean, logical and bulletproof. Don't break the WIQL queries.
