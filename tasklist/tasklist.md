2. **wit-personal-workload-analyzer Output Format**
   - Returns markdown text in `detailedAnalysis.workloadBalance.assessment` field
   - Should be structured JSON for programmatic use
   - Makes parsing difficult for automated workflows

   - Need end-to-end test: create handle ‚Üí validate ‚Üí use ‚Üí expire
   - Verify 1-hour expiration
   - Test pagination of handle list

4. **Bulk Operations Safety Not Verified**
   - All bulk ops have dry-run mode (good!)
   - Need to verify dry-run actually prevents changes
   - Test itemSelector functionality
   - Verify template variable substitution in bulk comments

5. **WIQL Query Tool Not Fully Tested**
   - Most important tool (foundation for query handles)
   - Pattern filters untested (duplicates, placeholder_titles, etc.)

   - Should return structured: { assignments: [], capacity: {}, riskFlags: [] }
   - Makes programmatic use difficult

2. **GitHub Copilot GUID Lookup**
   - Currently requires manual GUID entry
   - Should lookup by name
   - Improves UX for copilot assignment tools

3. **Browser Auto-Launch for Token**
   - Token acquisition shouldn't pop up browser
   - Disrupts workflow
   - Check Azure CLI integration

4. **Team Velocity Prompt Days Parameter**
   - Different day values return same results
   - Parameter may not be properly passed to query

5. **AI Assignment Prompt Context Info**
   - Should auto-fill work item ID context
   - Currently requires manual entry

### üìù Low Priority Issues
1. **wit-discover-tools Recommendations**
   - Should warn when recommending AI tools without sampling
   - Currently doesn't indicate sampling requirement in response

2. **Prompt Review Needed**
   - Remove "new" or "improved" mentions (no value)
   - Ensure valid link format
   - Exclude Done/Removed items (except velocity analyzer)
   - Verify tool lists match actual available tools
   - Audit auto-filling behavior

3. **Documentation Gaps**
   - Add performance expectations (tool execution times)
   - End-to-end workflow examples
   - Clear AI vs rule-based tool guidance
   - Where different file types belong

4. **Response Payload Optimization**
   - Some tools return verbose, duplicated data
   - Empty fields included unnecessarily

## Architecture Observations

### ‚úÖ Strengths
1. **Query Handle Pattern**
   - Excellent anti-hallucination design
   - Consistent across all bulk operations
   - 1-hour expiration is reasonable

2. **Dry-Run Mode**
   - Present in all bulk operations
   - Bulk state transitions/iterations default to dry-run=true (safety-first)

3. **itemSelector Pattern**
   - Flexible: "all", indices [0,1,2], or criteria-based
   - Preview tool (wit-select-items-from-query-handle) prevents errors

4. **Configuration Auto-Fill**
   - Organization, project, area path auto-filled
   - Only override when needed
   - Reduces parameter complexity

5. **Comprehensive Tool Discovery**
   - wit-discover-tools provides AI-powered recommendations
   - 38 tools well-organized into categories

6. **Sampling Integration**
   - Clear separation: 27 non-AI, 11 AI-powered tools
   - Graceful handling when sampling unavailable

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas for Improvement
1. **Tool Service Routing**
   - Large if-else chain in tool-service.ts
   - Consider handler factory pattern

2. **Error Response Consistency**
   - Should audit all handlers for consistent ToolExecutionResult format
   - Ensure errors array, warnings array, metadata consistency

3. **Response Optimization**
   - Some tools return excessive data
   - Consider: summary/preview/full response formats (bulk enhance descriptions already has this!)

4. **Naming Consistency**
   - File naming: mix of kebab-case and camelCase
   - Function naming: mix of handle* and action verbs
   - Variable naming: mix of camelCase and PascalCase

# Legacy Tasklist Items (Moved from root tasklist.md)

- ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS WORK: Standardize Naming:
    - Standardize file naming: Mix of kebab-case (query-handle-service.ts) and camelCase - pick one
    - Standardize function naming: Some use handle*, others use action verbs - be consistent
    - Standardize variable naming: Config uses mix of camelCase and PascalCase
- Create test fixtures/factories: Avoid hardcoded test data - use factories for work items, queries, etc. 
- Extract handler logic into service layer: Many handlers likely contain business logic that should be in services for better testability and reusability
- ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL: Remove "any" types - Many remain (200+ matches mostly in test files using `(result.data as any)` pattern, 2 in schemas.ts for legitimate flexibility, ~10 in actual source code)
- Extract query logic from query-handle-service: The service likely has multiple responsibilities - consider splitting into QueryExecutor, QueryCache, QueryValidator services
- Create a proper ADO client abstraction: Abstract the HTTP client into a clean service boundary with proper error handling, retry logic, and rate limiting. This is especially important since we may want to allow some of our tools to support multiple work item management systems eventually
- Implement repository pattern for work items: Separate data access logic from business logic
- Standardize error response format: Ensure all handlers return consistent error structures using response-builder
- Create a handler factory pattern: Centralize handler registration and routing instead of the massive switch/if-else in tool-service.ts
- ‚ö†Ô∏è TODO: Add more deterministic reliable tools baked in with the AI based ones to help the AI reach a better query which limits results correctly 
- ‚ö†Ô∏è TODO: Standardize tool naming patterns (currently inconsistent verb-object, noun, action-method)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è TODO: Review all prompts under the /prompts directory to follow best practices. Use the prompt improver chatmode to make fixes. Remove mentions of "new" or "improved" since they don't add value
- ‚ö†Ô∏è TODO: Ensure all prompts output links in valid format
- ‚ö†Ô∏è TODO: Ensure prompts don't look at Done/Removed items (except velocity analyzer)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è TODO: Make sure prompts only list tools that are actually needed for that prompt
- ‚ö†Ô∏è TODO: Review auto filling for prompts to make sure that everything is filled in as expected
- ‚ö†Ô∏è TODO: Fix `wit-sprint-planning-analyzer` output format (change from 2000+ word essay to JSON with assignments, capacity, risk flags)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è TODO: Fix GitHub Copilot GUID lookup (eliminate need to manually enter, look up by name instead)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è TODO: Fix browser auto-launch for token (should not pop up browser)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è TODO: Fix team velocity prompt days parameter (entering different days returns same results)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è TODO: Fix context info auto-fill in AI assignment prompt (should look up work item ID automatically)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è TODO: Add performance expectations to resources (how long each tool takes)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è TODO: Add end-to-end workflow examples to resources (tool combinations)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è TODO: Document when to use AI vs rule-based tools clearly in resources offered
- ‚ö†Ô∏è TODO: Comprehensively audit all resources for accuracy after changes
- ‚ö†Ô∏è TODO: Add documentation explaining where different types of files belong
- ‚ö†Ô∏è TODO: Limit the json returned by tool calls to what is useful. Don't include duplicated info, empty fields, long verbose data not requested etc. We need to optimize the callers context window
- ‚ö†Ô∏è TODO: Cleanup:
    - After all other tasks perform a general cleanup again to remove files which are no longer needed
    - Remove redundant and overly verbose code
    - Check for redundant backup code. Since we are pre-production we don't want to support legacy anything, redundancy etc. Move fast and break things
